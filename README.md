### General
The future official website for the Integrate Institute for Self-reliance.  This is a non-profit organization that has not yet been formally established so the site is currently not hosted on an official domain and some links are not yet activated.

As the organization develops, the site will be updated to reflect the current status and this repository may become private.

For now, the site is used for explanatory purposes to help the Board of Directors communicate with consultants.
