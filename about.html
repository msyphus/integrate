        <h3 class="adjTitle">Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            In the Global Self-Reliance Institute, we want to provide long-term solutions to problems plaguing society.  We strongly 
            believe that promoting self-reliance in individuals is one of the most effective ways to do this because individuals have better lives 
            and are better able to make a positive difference in their communities when they are able to provide for their own necessities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But we also didn't just want to be another charitable organization.  Self-reliant individuals cannot have an attitude of entitlement 
            so we wanted to provide a way for beneficiaries to feel like they are working for the help they receive.  This would not only give them 
            a sense of accomplishment and pride, but it would also give them real-life work experience that can make them more marketable in their 
            job search.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we wanted to teach self-reliance by example.  One common criticism of non-profit organizations is that people donate to them 
            with the intent of helping needy individuals, but their donation gets spent on paying for the organization's operational expenses instead (such
            as an executive's salary or buying pizza for fundraiser volunteers).  We wanted to create an organization that would produce products and services 
            that could also create revenue to cover operational expenses so that 100% of all donations would go directly to assisting needy individuals and 
            communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our plan for accomplishing all of this is to have our services offered to needy individuals with no monetary payment. "Payment" instead 
            comes from fulfilling an internship either within our organization or with an external organization.  There is a time limit on the 
            assistance program to ensure individuals do not develop a sense of complacency or entitlement.  Non-needy individuals, as well as organizations, 
            may also use our services, but they must pay for them.  Some of our training programs may also produce products, such as software applications, 
            that can generate revenue to help cover operational expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we want to be an entirely self-reliant organization that directly allocates 100% of all donations to the 
            assistance of needy individuals and communities, we recognize that it will take time to get to that point and that "rainy days" may create 
            the need for temporary adjustments.  Therefore, we will need to use donations for operational expenditures during our start-up phase and 
            other times of organizational need.  But this will always be done with intent to become or restore self-reliance as quickly as possible. 
            In this way, we are teaching by example because we want our beneficiaries to understand that there is nothing wrong with asking for help 
            when it is needed, but relying on help is not a sustainable long-term plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although our focus is on long-term solutions, we recognize that needy individuals have immediate needs.  Therefore, we plan on having 
            partnerships with other organizations that provide immediate assistance for housing, food, societal integration, and other needs.

            <h3>Our Operations</h3>
            <p>
                Self-reliance is more than just having a job and meeting current day-to-day needs.  It must also look forward
                and prepare for the future.  Retirement planning, emergency preparedness, health, and well-being are all vital
                for maintaining self-reliance.  This is why our services extend beyond just career development and also focus
                on lifestyle coaching, food and water innovation, and environmental responsibility.

            <h3 class="adjTitle">Career Development</h3>
            <p>
                The first step we take to build self-reliant individuals is to enroll them in a career development program.  This program
                consists of academic training in a chosen field of study coupled with an internship to get relevant work experience.  Job searching
                skills are also included in the program that cover topics such as networking, resume writing, social media use, and interviewing skills.
                By the end of the program, students will have a strong foundational knowledge of their chosen field, relevant work experience, a polished
                resume and social media presence, and valuable soft-skills to help them find and keep a good job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our teaching method is based on the idea of taking what is taught in the classroom and practicing it in the real world.  This doesn't just 
                improve retention, but it also teaches how to apply principles in a variety of situations while also building a resume.  We also believe 
                that students will be more serious about their studies if they see that what they are learning is actually practical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Education alone is not sufficient to get a good job, which is why our program requires an internship.  Students will be placed with managers 
                who are aware of the academic curriculum and focus on helping the student apply it in day-to-day job duties.  Many internships will be 
                for internal Global Self-Reliance Institute positions, but there will also be partnerships with external companies for additional internship 
                opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students work with a career coach who helps them develop their career development plan.  The training programs are designed to last at least six
                months and no more than two years.  The duration of the program depends on the chosen field and goals of the student.  The program must be long enough
                to build a strong foundation to get placed in a good job without being so long that it creates a sense of entitlement to help or unnecessary delay in
                getting a good job.

            <h3 class="adjTitle">Food and Water Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                Food and water innovation is important for promoting self-reliance because humans
                can't exist without food and water, yet so many people don't have safe or healthy food or water.  World food
                demand is continuing to increase while food production is decreasing.  With our globalized economy, a food
                crisis in a distant land can have drastic effects throughout the world that can affect individual self-reliance. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                Additionally, many people like to grow their own food.  There have been many creative home gardening ideas develop, 
                but they are not necessarily safe.  Eating unsafe food may lead to future health problems that can affect an individual's
                self-reliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Food and Water Innovation Division conducts research projects to better understand challenges and find sustainable solutions to them. 
                Additionally, we conduct development projects to improve communities.

            <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                Environmental issues can have devastating consequences.  Whether it be pollution that creates disease, unbalanced
                ecosystems that disrupt food supplies, or poorly managed natural resources that lead to economic challenges, how
                individuals and communities treat their environment can help or hinder self-reliance.
