                We will also seek to publish reports in relevant professional journals and media channels.

            <h3>Lean Prepper</h3>
            <h4>In process!</h4>
            <p>
                Emergency preparedness is an important part of self-reliance yet too many people don't do it, or don't do it 
                efficiently.  We are currently developing a method of emergency preparedness based upon Lean principles for 
                business operations.  This is designed to help people be prepared for difficult times without being wasteful 
                in how it's done.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the project is complete, we will have an app for mobile devices that will provide training in the Lean Prepper 
                method as well as provide tools to implement it.  We will also have training videos posted on our 
                <a href="#" target="_blank">YouTube channel.</a>

        <h3 class="adjTitle">Yard Garden Network</h3>
        <p>
            There is a major societal push towards finding "renewable" natural resources.  While this is good, it is not 
            complete.  Even if we find renewable resources, if we continue to waste resources the way we are currently 
            wasting resources, we will soon deplete our new resources before they are able to be renewed.  Tackling waste 
            is something that can happen right now!
        </p>
        <p>
            One waste that is sitting right under our noses is yards.  It is extremely common for people to have yards 
            but not take care of them.  They either don't have time to do it, don't know how to do it, or simply don't want 
            to do it.  How many times have you seen people with fruit treats in their yard that produce fruit that is never 
            picked or gets infested with worms?  There are unused portions of yards all over the place.  If we combined these 
            spaces, we could free up a significant amount of arable land towards food production.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to investigate the feasibility of a cooperative community yard gardening network.  In this program, 
            interested participants would let us do the gardening for them on spots of their own yards.  Our interns, under 
            supervision from professional staff, would do the weeding, watering, fertilizing, etc.  We can also 
            provide training for people who are interested in gardening themselves but are unsure how to do it.  We perform 
            our services in exchange for a share of the crops produced in the yard.  The crops we receive from the project 
            will be donated to local food banks so that needy individuals can have nutritious food to eat.

            <h3>Restaurant Waste Recycling for Vermiculture</h3>
            <p>
                We love eating out at restaurants!  We also have food safety regulations and social norms that lead to the 
                creation of a lot of garbage from these facilities.  Most garbage from restaurants is organic material such 
                as food scraps or paper products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Organic waste is actually quite useful.  We want to investigate the feasibility of creating a restaurant waste 
                recycling program to sort organic waste and utilize it to farm worms.  Worms can be used as a food source to 
                raise other animals like chickens or fish while also producing castings that make valuable fertilizers for 
                growing fruits and vegetables.

            <h3 class="adjTitle">Farming Forage Fish</h3>
            <p>
                Fish meal and fish oil use in aquaculture is <i>the</i> big topic.  Using fish to grow fish is an  
                unsustainable practice because it depletes the bottom of the oceanic food chain.  As a result, extensive 
                research is done to find alternative ingredients.  Unfortunately, these alternatives are usually from human 
                food sources (such as soy), can negatively affect the nutritional content of the fish for humans, and can create
                culturing problems for the farmers.  Therefore, this is not an ideal solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although fish farming takes the heat of this argument, many people don't realize that pet food has the same
                issue.  Dogs and cats are also depleting the ocean supplies of forage fish species!
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to ask, "Why not just farm the forage species?"  Theoretically, they eat phytoplankton so they won't 
                deplete ocean resources.  They are also highly fecund, adapted to high population densities, and do not need to 
                be raised to large sizes.  We believe it is possible to raise these species of fish in sustainable, efficient 
                ways so that they can then be used to feed our farmed fish and pets without depleting ocean populations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has not been done before so there is much research needed to evaluate the biological and economical 
                feasibility of such an endeavor.

            <h3 class="adjTitle">Evaluating Toxin Leaching -- Aquaculture</h3>
            <p>
                Farm-raised aquatic animals tend to be raised in man-made structures.  These structures are made of cement, 
                fiberglass, rubber, glass, or plastics.  Unfortunately, there is scientific evidence that these materials 
                leach dangerous toxins into water that can deposit themselves in animal fats and muscles.  Despite this, there 
                has not been any research investigating the safety of farm-raised animals cultured in such conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Critics of the aquaculture industry sometimes create a fuss about the use of PVC pipe in aquaculture systems.  
                However, household plumbing also uses PVC pipe.  Therefore, understanding the truth behind this issue will 
                not only improve the aquaculture industry, but may also lead to improvements in basic plumbing systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To be clear, we're not trying to take sides for or against aquaculture, PVC pipe, or anything else.  We just 
                want to understand if there's a health issue or not.  If there isn't, we can put the argument to rest.  If there 
                is, we will need to find solutions to the problem!

                Aquaponics and hydroponics are popular practices, especially amongst hobbyists.  The concept is noble and 
                exciting, but there are potentially dangerous risks invovled due to toxin leaching of plastics and other 
                salvaged materials typically used amongst hobbyists.  We want to understand the levels of toxin leaching 
                in these types of systems and how they affect the food produced from them.

            <p>
                Scientific evidence exists that shows leaching of toxins into soil from man-made materials such as plastics, 
                rubbers, and metals.  These materials frequently find themselves in household gardens from pots, weed barriers, 
                decorations, fences, sprinkling systems, and other things.  We want to understand if this is creating a health 
                risk.

            <h3>Innovation in Integrated Farm/Engergy Operations</h3>
            <p>
                World food demand is continually increasing yet the number of farmers throughout the world is decreasing.  
                Farming is a risky business!  We are always looking for innovative ways to improve the livelihood of farmers. 
                Integrating alternative engergy sources, such as solar or wind power, with farms has the potential to not 
                just improve world energy production, but also to supplement farmer income to make the profession more attractive 
                to draw in more young farmers.
