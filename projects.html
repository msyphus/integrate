                The first step we take to build self-reliant individuals is to enroll them in a career development program.  This program
                consists of academic training in a chosen field of study coupled with an internship to get relevant work experience.  Job searching
                skills are also included in the program that cover topics such as networking, resume writing, social media use, and interviewing skills.
                By the end of the program, students will have a strong foundational knowledge of their chosen field, relevant work experience, a polished
                resume and social media presence, and valuable soft-skills to help them find and keep a good job.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our teaching method is based on the idea of taking what is taught in the classroom and practicing it in the real world.  This doesn't just 
                improve retention, but it also teaches how to apply principles in a variety of situations while also building a resume.  We also believe 
                that students will be more serious about their studies if they see that what they are learning is actually practical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Education alone is not sufficient to get a good job, which is why our program requires an internship.  Students will be placed with managers 
                who are aware of the academic curriculum and focus on helping the student apply it in day-to-day job duties.  Many internships will be 
                for internal Global Self-Reliance Institute positions, but there will also be partnerships with external companies for additional internship 
                opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students work with a career coach who helps them develop their career development plan.  The training programs are designed to last at least six
                months and no more than two years.  The duration of the program depends on the chosen field and goals of the student.  The program must be long enough
                to build a strong foundation to get placed in a good job without being so long that it creates a sense of entitlement to help or unnecessary delay in
                getting a good job.

            <h3 class="adjTitle">Food and Water Innovation</h3>
            <p>
                Food and water innovation is important for promoting self-reliance because humans
                can't exist without food and water, yet so many people don't have safe or healthy food or water.  World food
                demand is continuing to increase while food production is decreasing.  With our globalized economy, a food
                crisis in a distant land can have drastic effects throughout the world that can affect individual self-reliance. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                Additionally, many people like to grow their own food.  There have been many creative home gardening ideas develop, 
                but they are not necessarily safe.  Eating unsafe food may lead to future health problems that can affect an individual's
                self-reliance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Food and Water Innovation Division conducts research projects to better understand challenges and find sustainable solutions to them. 
                Additionally, we conduct development projects to improve communities.

            <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                Environmental issues can have devastating consequences.  Whether it be pollution that creates disease, unbalanced
                ecosystems that disrupt food supplies, or poorly managed natural resources that lead to economic challenges, how
                individuals and communities treat their environment can help or hinder self-reliance.
